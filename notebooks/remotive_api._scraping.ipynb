Adhering to these limits (e.g., by introducing `time.sleep()` if making multiple sequential calls) ensures continued access and good standing with the service provider. Remotive's API documentation advises a maximum of 4 requests per day for general data, and excessive requests (more than 2x per minute) will be blocked."
